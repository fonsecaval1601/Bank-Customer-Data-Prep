# 🏦 Bank Customer Data Preparation & Exploration
##  A Data Science Case Study | Customer Churn & Segmentation Project

## 🎯 Overview
This project showcases my work preparing and exploring customer data for a national banking institution. The goal was to transform raw operational data into a clean, validated, and insights-ready dataset to support two machine learning initiatives: Customer Churn Prediction and Customer Segmentation.

I led the full data preparation workflow, including data integration, quality assurance, cleaning, exploratory analysis, and feature preparation for modeling.

## 🌍 Context
The Bank of Mavenland—a large financial institution in a data-centric region—was experiencing:

-  An increase in customer churn  
-  A slowdown in customer acquisition  
-  A lack of clarity around the drivers of these trends  

The product team sought a deeper understanding of customer behavior and needed data prepared for advanced analytics. I was hired as a Data Scientist to build the foundation for two high-impact machine learning projects.

## 🧩 Project Challenges
The data existed across several disconnected sources, each with different formats, inconsistencies, and quality issues. Before any modeling could begin, the data needed to be:

-  Joined accurately  
-  Cleaned thoroughly  
-  Audited for quality  
-  Explored for meaningful patterns  

## 👨‍💻 My Role
I was responsible for transforming the raw data into an analysis-ready asset and uncovering early insights that could guide the product and modeling teams.  
This included:

-  Data integration  
-  Data cleaning & standardization  
-  Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
-  Feature engineering  
-  Preparing inputs for machine learning pipelines
